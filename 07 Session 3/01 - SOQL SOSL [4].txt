SOQL - Salesforce Object Query Language
    - It retrieves records from Slaesforce objects, similar to SQL in databases.

SOSL - Salesforce Object Search Language 
    - A Search-based query language.
    - Performs full-text searches accross multiple Salesforce projects.

When to use each?
- Use SOQL for targeted queries to retrieve specific data from Salesforce objects (eg. finding all accounts starting with "Tech")
- Use SOSL for broader searches accross multiple objects, like a search engine (eg. searching for "Tech" across Accounts, Contacts and Leads)

SELECT Name, Industry, AnnualRevenue FROM Account WHERE AnnualRevenue > 500000
FIND {Edge} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account(Id, Name), Contact(Id, FirstName, LastName, Email)

SELECT fields
FROM objects
WHERE condition
ORDER BY Field ASC/DESC
LIMIT Limit Number

- Reserve characters and escaping in SOQL

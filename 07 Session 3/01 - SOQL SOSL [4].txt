SOQL - Salesforce Object Query Language
    - It retrieves records from Slaesforce objects, similar to SQL in databases.

SOSL - Salesforce Object Search Language 
    - A Search-based query language.
    - Performs full-text searches accross multiple Salesforce projects.

When to use each?
- Use SOQL for targeted queries to retrieve specific data from Salesforce objects (eg. finding all accounts starting with "Tech")
- Use SOSL for broader searches accross multiple objects, like a search engine (eg. searching for "Tech" across Accounts, Contacts and Leads)

SELECT Name, Industry, AnnualRevenue FROM Account WHERE AnnualRevenue > 500000
FIND {Edge} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account(Id, Name), Contact(Id, FirstName, LastName, Email)

SELECT fields
FROM objects
WHERE condition
ORDER BY Field ASC/DESC
LIMIT Limit Number

- Reserve characters and escaping in SOQL

SOQL Aggegate Functions and Working Results in Apex.
SELECT COUNT(Id) noAccounts, SUM(AnnualRevenue) totalRevenue FROM Account 

List<AggregateResult> lstResults=[SELECT COUNT(Id) noAccounts, SUM(AnnualRevenue) totalRevenue FROM Account];
System.debug('AggregateResult '+lstResults);

for (AggregateResult resultObj : lstResults) {
    Integer count = (Integer)resultObj.get('noAccounts');
    Decimal revenue = (Decimal)resultObj.get('totalRevenue');
    
    System.debug('Count '+count);
    System.debug('Revenue '+revenue);
}

- Aggegate Functions are common functions as:
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() Used to calculate directly in SOQL queries.

- Handling Aggregate Results in Apex: Aggregate results are not retured as sObject but as AggregateResult objects.
eg. Using AggregateResult to extract calculated data in Apex.

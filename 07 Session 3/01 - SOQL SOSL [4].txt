SOQL - Salesforce Object Query Language
    - It retrieves records from Slaesforce objects, similar to SQL in databases.

SOSL - Salesforce Object Search Language 
    - A Search-based query language.
    - Performs full-text searches accross multiple Salesforce projects.

When to use each?
- Use SOQL for targeted queries to retrieve specific data from Salesforce objects (eg. finding all accounts starting with "Tech")
- Use SOSL for broader searches accross multiple objects, like a search engine (eg. searching for "Tech" across Accounts, Contacts and Leads)

SELECT Name, Industry, AnnualRevenue FROM Account WHERE AnnualRevenue > 500000
FIND {Edge} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account(Id, Name), Contact(Id, FirstName, LastName, Email)

SELECT fields
FROM objects
WHERE condition
ORDER BY Field ASC/DESC
LIMIT Limit Number

- Reserve characters and escaping in SOQL

SOQL Aggegate Functions and Working Results in Apex.
SELECT COUNT(Id) noAccounts, SUM(AnnualRevenue) totalRevenue FROM Account 

List<AggregateResult> lstResults=[SELECT COUNT(Id) noAccounts, SUM(AnnualRevenue) totalRevenue FROM Account];
System.debug('AggregateResult '+lstResults);

for (AggregateResult resultObj : lstResults) {
    Integer count = (Integer)resultObj.get('noAccounts');
    Decimal revenue = (Decimal)resultObj.get('totalRevenue');
    
    System.debug('Count '+count);
    System.debug('Revenue '+revenue);
}

- Aggegate Functions are common functions as:
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() Used to calculate directly in SOQL queries.

- Handling Aggregate Results in Apex: Aggregate results are not retured as sObject but as AggregateResult objects.
eg. Using AggregateResult to extract calculated data in Apex.

GROUPING AND FILTERING AGGREGATE RESULTS WITH GROUP BY AND HAVING
GROUP BY:
- Group records based on specified fields.
- Used to Aggregatedata by categories or groups.

HAVING Clause:
- Used to filter aggregated results.
- Work like the WHERE clause but applies conditions to grouped records.

Difference between WHERE and HAVING:
- WHERE filters records before aggregation.
- HAVING filters records after aggregation.


SELECT Industry, COUNT(Id) noAccounts, SUM(AnnualRevenue) totalRevenue 
FROM Account 
WHERE AnnualRevenue > 100000
GROUP BY Industry 
HAVING SUM(AnnualRevenue ) > 9000000
